- Hey there. My name's Brian Damage.
- I like messing with (and usually bricking) hardware & "building" systems. Also interested in online safety/privacy issues
- 🌱 I’m a Linux noob, currently learning Parrot OS, Kali, Fedora, Manjaro & the guitar
- 💞️ I’m looking to learn a bit of coding but am overwhelmed as to where to start. Do noobs even use Github? Everyone here seems to be experts. 
- I'd love to learn enough to one be of some use to people in countries that have little, or no, internet freedom etc.
- Erm...HELP!!!
